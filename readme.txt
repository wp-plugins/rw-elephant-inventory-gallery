Gallery displays R.W. Elephant rental inventory on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin displays a gallery of your R.W. Elephant rental inventory. The inventory is updated in real time via the R.W. Elephant API. To use this plugin you will need an R.W. Elephant account.

The gallery appearance is customizable. Using the settings page on your WordPress Dashboard, choose the name for your gallery and the location you want it displayed on your site. You can choose one of the included template designs or customize your own. You can also select the thumbnail size and which social sharing links to display on your items.


== Installation ==

Note: You need an R.W. Elephant ID and API key to use this plugin.

1. Upload the `rwe-gallery` directory and its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Edit the plugin settings and enter your R.W. Elephant ID and API key and select the page on your site to display the gallery.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an R.W. Elephant ID and API key? =

Visit [R.W. Elephant](http://www.rwelephant.com/) to sign up.


= Why does my gallery say `No Categories Found`? =

Check to make sure your R.W. Elephant ID and API key are correct. In some rare cases, a web server may block outgoing HTTP requests which prevents this plugin from communicating with the R.W. Elephant API.


= How do I change the title format?  =

The <title> HTML element is used to define the title of your browser window, the title used by search engines and the default name for a bookmark. You can change the title format in R.W. Elephant Inventory Gallery settings on the WordPress Dashboard. The following placeholders are available: [title] [separator] [gallery_name]. These placeholders will be replaced with the corresponding data on each gallery page. You can choose which placeholders to use and add additional characters as desired to customize the title of your gallery pages.

[title] = Name of the current category if viewing a category page, tag name when viewing a tag page, `search: ___` when searching or the item name on an item detail page.

[separator] = Separator caharcter(s) set by your selected theme (Usually set using wp_title in your theme's header.php).

[gallery_name] = The name of your gallery.

Most WordPress themes automatically append your site name to the end of the title, so the title format should normally end with a separator and a space. If your theme puts your site name first, begin with a space and a separator. The home page of your gallery will use the title of the WordPress page you have chosen for your gallery and will not use the gallery name or title format of the plugin. To change that title, edit the WordPress page you have chosen for your gallery.


= How to I customize the appearance of my gallery? =

See the section 'Customizing Templates' in readme.txt (Other Notes tab in the WordPress Plugin Directory).

== Customizing Templates ==

When modifying templates, create a `rw-elephant-templates` directory under your `wp-content` directory (`/wp-content/rw-elephant-templates/`). Then place modified templates directly in this folder, not in any sub-folder. You may copy from `/wp-content/plugins/rw-elephant-inventory-gallery/templates/common/` or any of the included templates). Only copy template files you wish to modify; if a template does not exist in the rw-elephant-templates directory, the default will be used. Moving the template location outside the plugin directory prevents future updates from overwriting your modified templates.

The gallery is displayed on the chosen WordPress page by inserting it into the content of the page. If you wish to change the appearance of the page beyond the content area, such as to change the page width or change the way the page heading is displayed, change the page template in your WordPress theme. To select a different WordPress page template (if your Theme supports multiple page layouts): Pages->Edit->[Select your gallery page]->Template. You can modify or make a new page template by editing your WordPress theme. Normally you will want to use a full width page template.

The R.W. Elephant Inventory Gallery uses its own templates for the layout of the gallery pages. You can modify the provided templates. A template named `custom` with minimal styling is provided if you wish to use it to build your own template design. The gallery templates use placeholders which are be replaced with the appropriate gallery information when the pages are displayed on your website.

The included templates are located in the `/wp-content/plugins/rwe-gallery/templates/` directory. In this directory you will find sub-directories named for each template style. The individual template files are located in each sub-directory. Some parts of templates are shared. The shared templates located in the `common` template directory. Do not modify the templates in this location (they will be overwritten when you update the plugin!). Instead place modified templates in `/wp-content/rw-elephant-templates/` as described above.
